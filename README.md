This project explores various error correction techniques available on D-Wave Quantum Annealers. We use the max-cut problem as our testbench. 
We also employ a custom 3-repetition code to link chains of qubits to enhance their resilience against chain-breaks. 
Our experiment shows that the 3-repetition code performs best in terms of minimizing chain-breaks and maximizing max-cut value.
